# variable in js: variable is container for data
null(we know what is inside null but it is null i.e. empty)  and undefined (we did not know what is inside undefined) is a special value in javascript
# javascript is dynamically typed language that means we can store any type of value and we do not need to tell the type of variable to javascript java's interpretre do that for us(we do ot need to tell the datatype)

# RULES FOR WRITING THE VARIABLE NAME IN JAVASCRIPT

Objects(Arrays,Function)  object is the collection of  values (datatype) it ahs key values pair
 to access a key from an object we can use two methods obj.keyname opr obj[keyname]

 # to change the value of a key inside a object we can do that not accessing the key name through its object name
